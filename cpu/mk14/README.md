# üß† MK14 in SystemVerilog

This project is a hardware recreation of the **Science of Cambridge MK14** microcomputer, implemented in SystemVerilog for FPGA platforms. It emulates the original 1977 kit computer, featuring the **National Semiconductor SC/MP (INS8060)** CPU, 7-segment LED display, and keypad interface.

## üï∞Ô∏è About the MK14

The **MK14** (Microcomputer Kit 14) was one of the earliest affordable home computers in the UK, released in 1977 by Science of Cambridge (founded by Clive Sinclair). It featured:

- **CPU**: National Semiconductor SC/MP (INS8060)
- **Memory**: 256 bytes RAM (expandable to 640 bytes), 512 bytes ROM
- **Display**: 8-digit 7-segment LED
- **Input**: 20-key hexadecimal keypad

Over 15,000 units were sold, making it a significant milestone in computing history.
