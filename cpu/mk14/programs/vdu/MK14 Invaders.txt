Hi, I've been a bit quiet recently as I've been multi-tasking on the VDU module and a new game. I mentioned some time back that I had started INVADERS for the MK14 and it's now ready to unveil. Got to say I'm pretty pleased with the end result.

- You have 5 lives
- When you clear all invaders from the screen a new set of invaders appear
- Hitting an invader gets you 1 point, up to a maximum 99 points
- The invaders are rotated around the screen (as opposed to zigzagging left/right). After 14 rotations the invaders drop down a row
- Key 1 to move shooter left
- Key 2 to shoot a bullet
- Key 3 to move shooter right
- Key GO to restart game once all lives are used
- Key ABORT to exit to monitor at any time
- All characters on screen are defined by constants, so easy to customise

The game requires continuous memory from 0x0200 to 0x07FF and also uses the MK14 base RAM. The memory map is:

0x200-0x2FF Video RAM top half of screen
0x300-0x3FF Video RAM lower half of screen
0x400-0x7FC Game code. Yes there are 4 bytes spare 
0xF20-0xF36 Game variables

There is also control of the VDU module via the INS8154. For correct operation the VDU TOPPAGE signal needs to be wired to PS1 to properly display the 2 pages of video RAM.

It takes 4 minutes to load using the standard tape interface and about 4 seconds using Coolsnaz2's M5Stick-C based fast loader.

Attached are a couple of screen shots and here's a link to a short video. I just bought a USB video capture device so the screen shots and video are direct from the VDU module.

I will be making the assembly code and hex available shortly - just want to add a few more comments to the code. I'm sure there are areas that can be made more memory efficient but for now it fits and it works.
