Please find attached below Solitaire for the MK14 with VDU display. The program requires the MK14 to be fully populated, and with additional memory between 0x0200 and 0x7FF.

Two versions are available, one for the RealView VDU with the enhanced graphics (solitaire_v1r.hex), and the other for the standard MK14 VDU character set (solitaire_v1o.hex).

The program executes at 0x0400 and the VDU memory needs to reside at 0x200.

You play the game using the standard MK14 keyboard. Keys 1 to 7 are used to move cards from the columns, key 8 is used to take a card from the hidden pack, key 9 is used to take a card from the pack, keys A to D are used to move cards to and from the foundation piles.

Limitations:-
The game has a few limitation, the game does not tell you when you have won or when you have made an illegal move, you are unable to undo a move, and the game will always take one card from the pack. To restart the game you have to hit the Abort key and re-enter the start address 0x400.

I would like to thank Realtime for the random number routine and for testing/playing the game a number of times during the games development.
